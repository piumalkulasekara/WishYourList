# Marking Scheme

## Please follow this:

1. Register and create an account – **10%**. Creating an account should involve list creation. So as
part of creating an account, the user should be prompted for the name and description of the
wish list.
2. Login/logout to your account – **30%** (using jQuery/Backbone/REST). Successful login should
cause the user’s list to be loaded and displayed in the page (if it has already been created).
3. View (ordered by priority)/add/edit/delete items on list (using jQuery/Backbone/REST) – **40%**.
Note that adding an item should insert it into the right place in the list. Also adding or deleting an
item should not cause the whole list to be re-loaded from the server.
4. Share list and view shared list – **20%**
