# WishYourList

## Coursework Description
The aim of this coursework is to develop a simple wish list application. This application will allow a
logged-in user (and only logged-in users) to:

1. **Create a wish list (they may only create one per account). This wish list is for presents or
gifts they want for a particular occasion (birthday, anniversary, Christmas etc.) A name and
description must be assigned to the list, as well as its owner.**
2. **Add an item to the wish list. This will describe the item (a title), a URL of the website where
the item can be bought (the URL should be to the item page on the external website), and
the price. Also, whether the item is Must-Have, Would be Nice to Have, or If You Can (these
are just examples of priority)**
3. **Delete an item**
4. **View the list, ordered by priority**
5. **Edit items (e.g, assign new priority or change the description)**
6. **Share the list. The user should be able to request a link to the list that only displays the items
(without the ability to edit or delete them), which they can then paste into an email and share
with people. When people click on the link, they should see the items on the list, its name
and description, as well as the name of its owner (and nothing else).**

In addition, users must be able to:

7. _**Register and create an account**_
8. _**Login to their account to see/edit or create their wish list**_

### Your application MUST be written using PHP/CodeIgniter and use Javascript AND Backbone.
